                            <h5>Air Terminals</h5>
                            <p>Air terminals channel lightning strike current on to down conductors. There are two
                                aspects to air terminals: (1) what kind they are and (2) where they are placed on a
                                structure so that they will collectively protect the entire structure.</p>
                            <p>There are two kinds of air terminals used across the world:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Conventional, which is a simple highly conductive rod – made of copper or aluminum.
                                    It is called Franklin rod.</li>
                                <li>Non-conventional air terminals</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Rodhini uses air terminals that are Franklin rods but with a slightly blunt tip as
                                advocated by scientific research published in 2000, in the Journal of Geophysical
                                Research, as having a greater chance of catching lightning strikes; these are now being
                                increasingly used in the USA, Canada and China.</p>

                            <h5>Non-conventional Air Terminals</h5>
                            <p>The non-conventional are of two kinds – early streamer emission (ESE) air terminals and
                                charge transfer systems (CTS). ESE emits a charge stream early – hence the name – when
                                quiescent charge conditions are detected in the cloud above. In this manner it is
                                claimed that such a terminal can preferentially connect with a charge streamer – called
                                a leader – coming down from the cloud and thus protect a large area of the structure.
                                International Standard IEC 62305 has not yet approved this due to not having validation
                                based on the physics. However, many of the tallest buildings in the world have ESE
                                terminals. These terminals are said to produce charges of tens of KV at their tips and
                                produce leaders in the presence of leaders from the clouds. Assuming this to be true, it
                                is difficult for cheaper installations to achieve this. Moreover, the battery charge
                                needs to be maintained with solar attachment or otherwise. </p>
                            <p>The supposed advantage of ESE air terminals is the coverage of a large area of the roof
                                of a large building and its premises. However, the relatively high initial cost and
                                periodic maintenance make ESE terminals impractical for homes and small buildings.
                                Franklin rods are the best option in such cases. Moreover, Franklin rods generally
                                require only an annual inspection for mechanical and electrical integrity. No battery
                                failure to worry about!</p>
                            <p>CTS air terminals look like a crown of thick needles atop a mast. Proponents of CTS air
                                terminals claim that ‘corona’ current emitted from their arrays of sharp points can help
                                to neutralize some of the charge in the cloud above and thus prevent a strike. But field
                                studies have not corroborated the claims. IE 62305 has not recommended CTS air
                                terminals.</p>

                            <h5>Placement of Air Terminals</h5>
                            <p>Having the right type of air terminal is not sufficient. They must have the right height
                                and be placed on the right locations on the structure so as to protect every portion of
                                the structure. RODHINI uses the well-known scientific method called the Rolling Sphere
                                Method to compute the location and heights of the terminals. This is the same method
                                used in NASA’s new strung-wire system – which is the same as a system with many Franklin
                                rods – to protect launch pads.</p>

                            <p>Down conductors pass on the strike current to the Earth Electrode System. They must have
                                low resistance and low self-inductance at the frequency of the lightning current. They
                                can touch the wall or metal parts so that the building and the conductor will be at the
                                same potential and no harm will be done to the wall or other materials in contact with
                                it.</p>
                            <p><span>Equipotential Bonding:</span> High voltage current passing through the down
                                conductor of an LPS can create large electric potentials as compared to objects adjacent
                                to it. This disparity can cause side jumps of charge, popularly known as ‘side flashes.’
                                So all metal bodies within 6 feet of the down conductor are connected using bonding
                                jumpers to the down conductor. The earthing for house wiring is to be connected to the
                                earthing of LPS through an equipotential bond. Likewise the live electric wires are to
                                be bonded to the LPS earth through a Surge Protector.</p>
                            <p><span>All-copper System:</span> Rodhini uses round conductors that are either sold or
                                woven. 20mmx3mm copper strip is also used. Rodhini manfactures stranded CU conductor
                                (see the stranded conductor next to the solid round conductor in the picture). Inquiries
                                are welcome. </p>

                                lightning protection. Rodhini manufactures the aluminum components. Coupled with the
                                copper underground, the total cost of the copper-aluminum LPS is about two-thirds of an
                                all-copper system for houses and low-rise buildings. For highrises the cost is half that
                                of copper. Rodhini is a pioneer in India in installing aluminum-copper LPS. Rodhini
                                manufactures AL stranded conductor for wholesale. Inquiries are welcome. </p>

                                IEC 62305 for earthing in different soil conditions. Accordingly, the system might be a
                                single earth rod or multiple rods, earthing plates, meshes, earthing trench, or a
                                combination of these to which the down conductor is connected.</p>

                            <p><span>OFFER:</span> In celebration of our 12th anniversary, we are happy to share with
                                you a token of our gratitude for allowing us to serve you. The offer is the following
                                reduction from Total Cost. For houses, the reduction is an amount equal to one-half the
                                GST. For other buildings, it is one-third the GST. See the Example 1 and the Example 2
                                below. </p>
                            <p>Total cost = Cost of (Materials + Design + Fabrication+ Transportation + Installation ) +
                                margin – LESS Offer </p>
                            <p><span>Materials:</span> Air terminals, down conductor, earth rods, steel pipes, pvc
                                pipes, junction box, pit covers, and fittings. (Customer may choose to provide the
                                materials. )</p>
                            <p><span>Design</span> (5% of Total Cost): Initial site visit testing resistivity of earth
                                beside the building or structure, and engineering computation of layout and
                                specifications of air terminals, down conductor, bondings, and earthing. </p>
                            <p><span>Fabrication</span> (5% of Total Cost): Assembly of air terminal(s) and mounting
                                mast(s)</p>
                            <p><span>Transportation:</span> Transportation of materials, supervising staff and workers
                                to and from site</p>
                            <p><span>Installation:</span> Engineering supervision of installation, on-site labor, use of
                                machines, Argon welding, Exothermic welding, testing/commissioning, and 14-year
                                warranty.</p>
                            <p><span>Margin:</span> Margin is necessary for a service company to exist with its
                                professional and technical staff and on-site workers so as to efficiently use raw
                                materials to provide the service. Margin can vary with the type of service industry,
                                from below 20% to well above 20%. Our margin is 19% of total cost.</p>
                            <p><span>Note A.</span> If the on-site labor required fewer workers and days, the
                                installation cost will be reduced in the final invoice. If the on-site labor requires
                                more workers and days, the final invoice will charge one-half the increased costs. </p>
                            <p><span>Note B.</span> If the installation needs removal and re-fitting of ground tiles
                                or/and roof ridges, then those costs (which are normally less than 6000) will be added
                                to the net cost.</p>
