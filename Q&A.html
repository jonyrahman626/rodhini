                                        <p>When a cloud filled with negative charges of electrical energy passes over
                                            earth
                                            it repels the negative charges below and attracts the positive charges.
                                            These
                                            positive charges still bound to the atoms in the earth move on the ground
                                            with
                                            the cloud. Along with the air between the cloud and the earth the
                                            configuration
                                            is now that of a large capacitor.

                                            <span>The material between the two sides of a capacitor is an insulator – in
                                                our case
                                                here, it is air. But there is no perfect insulator. Every insulator has
                                                a
                                                resistance value that can be measured under steady DC flow conditions.
                                                It is the
                                                ratio V/C, where V is the voltage applied and C is the leakage current
                                                or
                                                current observed after an elapse of time. The higher the insulation
                                                resistance
                                                the longer a capacitor can store the charges.</span>

                                            <span>When the voltage across our capacitor becomes larger and the
                                                insulation
                                                resistance of the air decreases, such as when a reduction occurs in the
                                                gap, the
                                                capacitor breaks down and a large current flows – the lightning strike.
                                                This is
                                                the cloud-to-earth lightning. The gap reduction occurs when the cloud
                                                passes
                                                over the high point of a hill, building or a tree.</span>

                                            <span>Cloud-to-cloud lightning, which is more common, occurs when the
                                                voltage
                                                difference between the top and bottom of the cloud exceeds the breakdown
                                                voltage
                                                of the capacitor formed by those two parts of the cloud.</span>

                                            <span>The question remains as to how a cloud acquires the negative
                                                charges?</span>

                                            <span>A cloud is a mixture of water droplets and aggregates of ice crystals.
                                                Now, in a
                                                cloud, there are updrafts of warm air and downdrafts of cold air. This
                                                movement
                                                of air past water droplets and ice crystals produces electric charges –
                                                the
                                                relative movement of molecules generates charges as in the case of a
                                                plastic
                                                comb acquiring electrons from the dry hair that is combed. Elsewhere on
                                                the web
                                                one can learn how the movement of air produces the charges and also why
                                                the
                                                bottom of the cloud becomes negatively charged while the top of the
                                                cloud
                                                becomes positively charged.</span>
                                            <span>It is an amazing phenomenon that in addition to the charge
                                                polarization that
                                                places the negative charges on the bottom of the cloud, a separate
                                                smaller
                                                aggregation of positive charges is produced elsewhere on the bottom of
                                                the
                                                cloud. This separate smaller aggregation arcs over to the negative
                                                portion which
                                                then arcs over to the top of the cloud or the ground.</span>

                                            structure, connected to earth with a high capacity conductor – called down
                                            conductor – with low impedance. When a charged thundercloud comes near
                                            enough to
                                            the rod, the induced positive charges moving on the ground with the cloud go
                                            up
                                            as an ‘early streamer’ from the lightning rod. At around 30 meters above the
                                            rod
                                            this streamer meets the streamer from the cloud – think how paper bits rise
                                            toward a charged comb – and neutralize. But there is more negative charge in
                                            the
                                            cloud and they continue to flow through the rod and the attached down
                                            conductor
                                            to meet the positive charges remaining on the ground below – this flow is
                                            known
                                            as a return stroke.

                                            <span>The charges flow through the down conductor since it has the least
                                                impedance among competing paths. The key phrase is ‘low impedance.’
                                                Achieving this requires technical expertise, which is why LPS must be
                                                installed by those who specialize in it and have experience and
                                                equipment.</span></p>

                                        <p>In the presence of a charged cloud above, all three systems produce a stream
                                            of
                                            charges upward. This stream of charges is called a corona emission current.

                                            <span>In the Franklin rod and the ESE, the emission current is immediate
                                                upon
                                                the presence of a charged cloud above. ESE is said to produce a stronger
                                                emission current because it is aided by the charge generated by the
                                                electrical system at the tip of the ESE. </span>

                                            <span>In both Franklin rod and ESE, the corona emission current has a higher
                                                chance of meeting the charge stream (called ‘leader’) from the cloud and
                                                thus produce a path through the air terminal to the ground; this
                                                prevents
                                                the leader from attaching elsewhere.</span>

                                            <span>CTS works differently. It has a crown comprising a cluster of sharp
                                                needles which continually dissipate charges. So there is a delay in the
                                                formation of the upward discharge. This causes a delay in attaching to a
                                                leader coming down from the clouds and the leaders fail to attach to the
                                                CTS, thus preventing the lightning. This delay produced is generally
                                                accepted as an index of the protective effectiveness of a CTS. But the
                                                leader coming down from the cloud may attach elsewhere.</span>

                                        <p>An ESE for even a small building is five to ten times more costly than a
                                            Franklin rod. Also, an ESE needs a battery in the electrical system at the
                                            tip of the terminal. This battery needs to be changed periodically. This is
                                            not always practical for small installations as the tip of the ESE terminal
                                            (which is several meters high) needs to be accessed without ladder to change
                                            the battery. Where the tip can be accessed without ladder and where a large
                                            area needs to be protected, ESE may be suitable and the higher cost can be
                                            justified. An example is the Burj Khalifa building in Dubai.

                                            <span>To protect a large area, a CTS at the highest point and Franklin rods
                                                at additional locations in the area is suitable. The reason is that CTS
                                                is said to prevent a lightning strike by delaying the attachment of the
                                                corona emission current from the the CTS to a downward leader from the
                                                cloud above. The downward leader from the cloud would attach elsewhere
                                                in the area; Franklin rods would receive those strikes. </span>

                                            <span>We conclude that Franklin rod is an effective and a least expensive
                                                solution when only a few of them suffice to protect a structure. For a
                                                larger area, an ESE placed at the highest point, with access to change
                                                the battery, would be a solution where otherwise several Franklin rods
                                                would be required. For large area, CTS also appears to work but
                                                additional Franklin rods would be required. CTS is cheaper than ESE but
                                                costlier than Franklin rods. Roughly their price is midway of Franklin
                                                rods and ESE.</span>

                                            <span>We conclude that for small buildings or small areas or where there is
                                                one high point in relation to the rest of the area, one or a few
                                                Franklin rods suffice. This is the practice in the USA and China. In
                                                China, large numbers of Franklin rods cover even large areas to be
                                                protected. </span>

                                            lightning on the power lines or on the house or near the house can cause
                                            damage to the equipments. So you need a surge protection device (SPD) at the
                                            electrical panel where the current enters the building. The SPD responds to
                                            surges by lowering its internal impedance so as to divert surge current to
                                            limit the voltage to its protective level-the measured limiting voltage.
                                            After the occurrence of surges, the SPD recovers to a high-impedance-state
                                            line-to-ground and extinguishes current to ground through the device when
                                            line voltage returns to normal.</p>

                                            are inside unlike the case when you are exposed outside away from the house;
                                            outside but near the house is also dangerous since the house is again the
                                            taller object and a hit on the house may do a side-flash on objects near it
                                            outside. <br>
                                            Now, if a LPS is installed on the house, are you safe inside the house?

                                            <span>Lightning protection is more than just the connected triple –
                                                air-termination system, down conductor and earth termination system. A
                                                lightning strike is a dc current that builds up to its maximum in about
                                                8 microseconds. This fast-varing current has a fast-varying magnetic
                                                field associated with it. This varying magnetic field induces an
                                                electric field on any conductor near the down conductor that is struck.
                                                The largest conductor configuration inside the building is the wiring.
                                                So the wiring earthing should be connected with the LPS grounding; the
                                                wiring and the bottom of the LPS system will then be at the same
                                                potential and hence safe.</span>

                                            <span>There are also the power surges that enter the building wiring from
                                                power supply outside. To supress these surges, surge suppressors must be
                                                installed at the entrance of power to the building. And the suppressor
                                                must be earthed with shorted bonding connection to the lightning ground
                                                rod.</span></p>

                                            age or stop working otherwise. Ageing occurs not only due to passage of time
                                            but also the number of surge events. The SPD cartridge begins to deteriorate
                                            with age – as shown by change in color in its indicator window. As the color
                                            begins to change, the cartridge needs to be replaced.

                                            <span>What happens if the cartridge is not replaced or there is a
                                                catastrophic surge event? Although such an event is rare, it is
                                                possible. Then the SPD would protect during the event but get sacrificed
                                                in the process. The residual current continuing through the SPD could
                                                then cause it to catch fire. This is prevented by a Circuit Breaker
                                                connected in series with the SPD so that the circuit breaker breaks the
                                                circuit by tripping.</span>

                                            <span>A question then is if a standard fuse would be sufficient in place of
                                                the MCB. A fuse would not suffice since each wire needs to have its own
                                                fuse and the fuses are not coordinated or ‘ganged’. So one may trip and
                                                another may not; that would still cause current to flow through the
                                                faulty SPD.</span>
                                            <span>The conclusion is that an MCB that matches the SPD be connected in
                                                series with it so that the SPD is between the MCB and earthing.</span>

                                        <p>Some trees suffer severe damage from lightning. Two trees can be hit by
                                            lightning and only one suffer severe damage. <span>The reason is
                                                conductivity. The tree that has more water content will sustain less
                                                damage because the more the water content, the more the conductivity (or
                                                less resistance). This is why electric stoves work. When large current
                                                passes through, high resistance wires heat up.</span></p>
